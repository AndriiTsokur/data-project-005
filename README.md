# Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

The dataset we'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between April 1, 1999 (almost the very beginning of the introduction of this currency into circulation - January 1, 1999), and September 27, 2024 (the date of creation of this project). [The euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (symbolized with €) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

[Daria Chemkaeva](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18) put together the data set and made it available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020) — the data source is the European Central Bank. Note that the dataset gets regular updates.

The main goal of the project is to practice explanatory data visualization and storytelling, focusing on the exchange rate **between the euro and the American dollar**.

**The tools used are:**

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
